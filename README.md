# MS Teams Keep Active

A Python utility that prevents Microsoft Teams from going inactive by simulating various types of user activity throughout the workday.

## Features

- **Multiple Activity Methods**: Rotates between mouse movements, keyboard inputs, scroll actions, and Teams-specific activities
- **Smart Window Focus**: Automatically detects and focuses Microsoft Teams windows for targeted activity simulation
- **Randomized Intervals**: Varies activity timing between 1-3 minutes to appear more natural
- **Automatic Exit**: Stops running after 5:30 PM by default
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Handle Ctrl+C interruption cleanly
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides clear console output showing activity status and timing

## Requirements

### System Dependencies
- **Linux**: This script is designed for Linux systems using X11 or XWayland
- **xdotool**: Required for simulating mouse and keyboard input

### Python Dependencies
- Python 3.x (no additional packages required - uses only standard library)

## Installation

1. **Install xdotool**
    ## Fedora/RHEL
   ```bash
   sudo dnf install xdotool
   ```
   ## Ubuntu/Debian
   ```bash
   sudo apt install xdotool
   ```
   ## Arch Linux
   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S xdotool
   ```

2. **Clone or download the script**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/friedcherries/ms-teams-keep-active.git
   cd ms-teams-keep-active
   ```

3. **Make executable** (optional):
   ```bash
   chmod +x keep_active.py
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python3 keep_active.py
```

### Background Execution
```bash
# Run in background
python3 keep_active.py &

# Or use nohup to persist after terminal closes
nohup python3 keep_active.py &
```

## How It Works

The script employs four different activity simulation methods:

1. **Mouse Jiggle**: Creates a small square movement pattern with the mouse cursor
2. **Key Combination**: Sends subtle key presses (Shift, F15, Ctrl)
3. **Scroll Activity**: Simulates mouse wheel scrolling up and down
4. **Teams-Specific Activity**: Focuses the Teams window and sends application-specific inputs

### Activity Rotation
- Methods rotate automatically to avoid predictable patterns
- Random intervals between 60-180 seconds (1-3 minutes)
- Always attempts to focus Teams window before simulating activity

### Automatic Shutdown
- Default exit time: 5:30 PM
- Modify the `exit_after()` function call in `main()` to change timing
- Example: `exit_after(18, 0)` for 6:00 PM shutdown

## Configuration

### Changing Exit Time
Edit the `exit_after()` call in the `main()` function:
```python
# Exit at 6:00 PM instead of 5:30 PM
exit_after(18, 0)
```

### Adjusting Activity Intervals
Modify the interval range in the main loop:
```python
# Change from 60-180 seconds to 30-120 seconds
interval_seconds = random.randint(30, 120)
```

## Output Example

```
üöÄ MS Teams Keep Active
üéØ Multiple activity methods, every 2 minutes
üîÑ Rotates between mouse, keyboard, and scroll methods
‚å®Ô∏è  Press Ctrl+C to stop

--- Activity cycle at 14:32:15 ---
üéØ Focused Teams window: Microsoft Teams - Chrome
üì± Teams-specific activity at 14:32:16
‚úÖ Teams window was focused for activity
‚è≥ Waiting 2 minutes...

--- Activity cycle at 14:34:28 ---
üñ±Ô∏è  Mouse pattern completed at 14:34:29
‚ö†Ô∏è  Could not focus Teams window
‚è≥ Waiting 1 minutes...
```

## Safety Features

- **Non-intrusive**: Activities are designed to be minimal and not interfere with actual work
- **Safe key combinations**: Uses modifier keys and function keys that typically don't trigger unwanted actions
- **Window detection**: Attempts to target Teams specifically rather than affecting other applications
- **Graceful exit**: Responds properly to interruption signals

## Troubleshooting

### "xdotool not found" Error
Install xdotool using your distribution's package manager (see Installation section).

### Teams Window Not Detected
- Ensure Microsoft Teams is running in a browser (Edge/Chrome)
- The script searches for windows containing "Teams" or "Microsoft Teams" in the title
- Check that Teams is visible (not minimized)

### Activity Not Preventing Idle Status
- Verify Teams is actually receiving focus when the script runs
- Try running Teams in a dedicated browser window rather than a tab
- Some corporate Teams configurations may have different idle detection methods
